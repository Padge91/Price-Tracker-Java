Price-Tracker
=============

Tracks changes in prices on Websites

Developer: Nick Padgett
Date: 20 May 2014

Java program that will track price changes on websites. Requires the html, price, and a description. 
Saves files to a file called "items.data" and loads them when program is opened.
Items being followed are in blue, while items that have met an indicated price are shown in green.
Items that consistently fail to find the html code they previously acquired will change color to red.
^^In this case, the only course of action is to update the item. It is likely the original html source was modified.
